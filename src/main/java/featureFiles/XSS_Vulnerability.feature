Feature: Testing XSS Vulnerability 
As a security tester I want to verify that the application is protected against XSS attacks So that user's data is safe from malicious scripts.

Scenario: Verifying XSS vulnerability in search bar 
Given I am on the homepage 
When I enter "<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>" in the search bar
And I click on the search button 
Then I should see the search results page 
And I should not see any popup or alert message 

Scenario: Verifying XSS vulnerability in comment section 
Given I am on the blog post page 
When I enter "<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>" in the comment section 
And I click on the submit button 
Then I should see the comment posted successfully 
And when I view the comment, I should not see the alert messagehas context menu
